	shorttitle = {Outdoor Walking Speeds of Apparently Healthy Adults},
	abstract = {Background
Walking outdoors can be used by many individuals to meet public health guidelines for moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity. The speed at which adults walk may be a proxy for intensity. Traditional estimates of indoor walking speed are unlikely to reflect self-selected usual or other instructed paces of outdoor walking speed.

Objective
To inform estimates of pace-based walking speed of apparently healthy adults in outdoor settings.

Methods
We searched four electronic databases for articles published in English between January 1970 and March 2019. Studies that reported walking speed (m/s), cadence (steps/min), or intensity ({mL}/kg/min) of ambulatory, apparently healthy, and community-dwelling adults ({\textgreater} 18 years) were included. Walking speed categories were defined according to the description provided in each study. Meta-analysis was used to synthesise speed, cadence, and intensity data by slow, usual, medium, fast, and maximal pace (where reported).

Results
Thirty-five studies, representing 14,015 participants (6808 women, 5135 men, and 2072 sex not specified), were identified. The mean (95\% {CI}) walking speed for slow, usual, medium, fast, and maximal pace was 0.82 (0.77–0.86), 1.31 (1.27–1.35), 1.47 (1.44–1.49), 1.72 (1.64–1.81), and 1.62 (1.45–1.79) m/s, respectively. Mean cadence (95\% {CI}) for usual and fast paces were 116.65 (114.95–118.35) and 126.75 (121.87–131.63) steps/min, respectively. The mean oxygen consumption (95\% {CI}) for the usual and medium paces was 11.97 (11.69–12.25) and 13.34 (12.94–13.73) {mL}/kg/min, respectively.

Conclusion
These findings provide greater clarity with regard to how various indicators of enacted walking pace, speed, and intensity overlap and how each can be best communicated in the real-world setting to optimise health-related outcomes. Pace-based instructions can be used to support walking in outdoor settings within public health guidelines.

configuration of the wheel has an offset distance between the wheel axle and the steering axle along the direction of wheel travelling. We then describe the kinematics and the control method of the offset steered driving wheel to provide an omnidirectional and holonomic capability for a vehicle by actuating the wheel axis and the steering axis
independently. The wheel is a nonholonomic system, and we introduce a control strategy to avoid a nonholonomic constraint. Simulation results of the single driving wheel and the two-wheeled vehicle are performed to test the control method. The concept of offset steered driving wheel is implemented and tested on a prototype of the holonomic omnidirectional vehicle.

The rela tionship between the rigid body motion of the robot and the steering and drive rates of wheels is developed.

Explicit differential equations are derived to describe the rigid body motions that arise in such ideal rolling trajectories. The simplest wheel configura tion that permits access of arbitrary rigid-body motions is determined. Then the question of slippage due to misalign ment of the wheels is investigated by minimization of a non- smooth convex dissipation functional that is derived from Coulomb's Law offriction. It is shown that this minimization principle is equivalent to the construction of quasi-static motions. Examples are presented to illustrate the models.},

Analysis of the mathematical model of this system using the holonomy matrix yields conditions under which the system can be rendered holonomic. Holonomy can be achieved by keeping the ball-carriers in pure translational motion. Therefore, the control of the system can be simplified by imposing constraints on the ball-carriers that prevent them from changing their orientation with respect to an inertial frame.},

	url = {http://dl.lib.uom.lk/handle/123/10482},
	abstract = {Most mobile platforms or vehicles used today are non holonomic. They only have one or two independent degrees of freedom. Due to that its maneuverability is limited and often requires much space to control functions like turning and parking. By improving degrees of freedom (improving the maneuverability) of a vehicle, it can follow many complex trajectories that are difficult or impossible by conventional non holonomic vehicles. Any mobile platform that has three independent degrees of freedom in a plane is a holonomic platform. Independent degrees of freedom means that it can change its orientation or position without effecting other motions unlike in car type vehicles that require turning or changing its orientation when need to move. Holonomic motion is very useful to acquire abilities such as, avoid any obstacle while keeping its orientation the same, capability to move in constrained spaces and track a target while moving in an arbitrary trajectories etc. Because of these advantages and capabilities some of the scientific and industrial researches are targeting to develop holonomic mobile platforms. Already robotics community have managed to build some working models and used in applications like robot soccer games and mobile robot manipulators. Many different mechanisms have been created to achieve the holonomic capability. These include various arrangements of Swedish wheels or omni wheels, chains of spherical or cylindrical wheels, ball wheels and powered caster wheels etc. While most of these designs are practical in indoor environments they are not suitable for outdoor operations in large scale versions. In this research project our goal was to develop a viable design to achieve holonomic capability that minimizes these problems and more suited to outdoor operations. The proposed design has a wheel arrangement similar to a car but with the capability of independent driving and steering capability of each of the four wheels. Car type rolling and steering mechanism avoid any uneven wear of the wheels and avoid lateral forces applied on the wheels. Wheel driving and steering mechanism was designed such a way that wheels can be steered 360 degrees continuously without interfering with the wheel drive system. This enables the platform to move in complex trajectories continuously without stopping for wheel resetting. The developed platform has increased ground clearance that is necessary for outdoor rough terrain operations like farming. Although these benefits exist, controlling the robot to acquire the desired motion is very complex and need innovative algorithm. Four independent wheels with eight degrees of freedoms to achieve three degree of freedom motion is a redundant control problem and require complex control system. Using inverse kinematics model of the platform and multiprocessor design with advance micro-controllers we have tried to solve these issues and were able to achieve successful performance.},

While eliminating the constraint forces, the number of scalar Lagrange equations is reduced to a number of independent equations lower than the original system with constraint forces. In the process of constraint-force elimination and dimension-reduction, a matrix that appears to play a relevant role in the formulation of the mathematical models of mechanical systems arises naturally. We call this matrix here the holonomy matrix. It is shown that necessary and sufficient conditions for the integrability of the constraints in Pfaffian form are readily derived using the holonomy matrix. In the same vein, a class of nonholonomic systems is identified, of current engineering relevance, that is termed quasiholonomic. Examples are included to illustrate these concepts.

This ball wheel mechanism can be designed to yield fully mobile vehicles that are not only free of any kinematic singularity but are configuration invariant in kinematic behavior. Invariant kinematics greatly simplifies the control of smooth and precise vehicle motion. Multiple displacement sensors are easily incorporated into each ball wheel mechanism. This unique feature enables the detection of slip between tires and the floor and also indicates at which tire the slip occurs. This allows traction control to be implemented to fully exploit the available floor friction while accurate dead reckoning navigation continues from two non slipping tires. A prototype vehicle with three ball wheel mechanisms is implemented. Smooth motion and precise dead reckoning are accomplished.},

	doi = {10.1109/70.265916},
	abstract = {Since a vehicle with two or more steerable drive wheels is always traveling in a circle about an instantaneous center of rotation, the motion of the wheels is constrained. The wheel translational velocity divided by the radius to the center of rotation must be the same for all wheels. When the drive wheels are controlled independently using position control, the motion of the wheels may violate the constraints and the wheels may slip. Consequently, substantial errors can occur in the position and orientation of the vehicle. A vehicle with N steerable drive wheels has N holonomic constraints on the steering angles, (N-1) nonholonomic constraints on the wheel velocities, and one degree of freedom. The authors have developed a new approach to the control of a vehicle with N steerable drive wheels. The novel aspect of their approach is the introduction of variables to control the constraint forces. To control the vehicle, the authors have one variable to control motion and (N-1) variables that can control the constraint forces to reduce errors. Kankaanranta and Koivo (1988) developed a control architecture that allows the control variables for force and position to be decoupled. In the work of Kankaaranta and Koivo the control variables for force are an exogenous input. The authors have made the central variables for force endogenous by defining them in terms of the errors in satisfying the nonholonomic constraints. The authors have applied the control architecture to the {HERMIES}-{III} robot and have measured a dramatic reduction in error (more than a factor of 20) compared to motions without constraint force control.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

All electronics, sensors, computers, and communication equipment required for autonomous operation of {HERMIES}-{III} are located on board along with sufficient battery power for three to four hours of operation. The paper first provides a more detailed description of the {HERMIES}-{III} characteristics, focussing on the new areas of research and demonstration now possible at {CESAR} with this new test-bed. The initial experimental program is then described with emphasis placed on autonomous performance of human-scale tasks (e.g., valve manipulation, use of tools), integration of a dexterous manipulator and platform motion in geometrically complex environments, and effective use of multiple cooperating robots ({HERMIES}-{IIB} and {HERMIES}- {III}). The paper concludes with a discussion of the integration problems and safety considerations necessarily arising from the set-up of an experimental program involving human-scale, multi-autonomous mobile robots performance. 10 refs., 3 figs.},

The problem of finding the "smoothest path" joining two given configurations is solved (a configu ration is a position and a direction). Generally, we solve the problem using two "simple " path segments. The most important issue is how to define the smoothness cost of a path. We pro pose two distinct definitions: the first is the path curvature, and the second is the derivative of the path curvature. We use cir cular arcs with the first definition, and we use "cubic spirals" with the second for "simple curves" respectively. The set of cubic spirals has several advantages when used in smooth-path planning, one of which is curvature continuity. This theory also reveals other important concepts in robotics, such as "symmet ric configurations " and "symmetric means.

The approach is based on geometric reasoning and provides deterministic trajectories for all pairs of initial and final configurations (position x, y, and orientation \{theta\}) of the robot. Furthermore, the method generates trajectories taking into account the forward and reverse mode of motion of the vehicle, or combination of these when complex maneuvering is involved or when the environment is obstructed with obstacles. The trajectory planning algorithm is described, and examples of trajectories generated for a variety of environmental conditions are presented. The generation of the trajectories only takes a few milliseconds of run time on a micro Vax, making the approach quite attractive for use as a real-time motion planner for teleoperated or sensor-based autonomous vehicles in complex environments. 10 refs., 11 figs.},

	abstract = {Various remote-controlled methods have been developed to improve operability using force or visual assists; however, using only force or visual assists may deteriorate the operability or safety performance. Therefore, a remote-controlled method with both force and visual assists is proposed to improve the operability while maintaining safety performance. The proposed remote-controlled system consists of a wheeled mobile robot, control device, and monitor. The force assist is generated using the time to collision ({TTC}), which is the predicted time of collision of the mobile robot against an obstacle. This force assist is applied to the operator using a control device to achieve collision avoidance. Using a visual assist, a predicted trajectory for the mobile robot based on the {TTC} is generated. For operability improvement, this predicted trajectory with color gradation is shown on the monitor. In summary, the achievement of operability improvement while maintaining safety performance is confirmed from experimental results using the proposed method.},

	shorttitle = {Aerial Following of a Non-holonomic Mobile Robot subject to Velocity Fields},
	abstract = {Surveillance is a major concern nowadays for the development of autonomous vehicles ({AVs}) technology, in particular during prototyping stage. However, it is unclear what an effective strategy is for aerial imagery with drones. On one hand, the dynamics of such autonomous vehicle is commonly subject to non-holonomic constraints, whose steering wheel is driven under the paradigm of look-ahead, i.e. users drive a car by looking forward, instead of minimizing the instantaneous position error as if navigating in a smooth velocity field. On the other hand, aerial footage is typically conducted with underactuated drones where admissible position trajectories are limited to a subset of paths. In this paper, a scheme for aerial visual servoing of a mobile ground robot tracking a smooth vector field is proposed. The scheme is based on structural properties and constraints of both systems, such as a non-holonomy, nonlinear dynamics and underactuation. The result is aerial surveillance of an autonomous vehicle mimicking how we drive a real vehicle by redefining locally smooth velocity field toward the next target through admissible paths. Experiments show the feasibility of the proposed scheme by controlling the quadrotor's underac-tuated positions (x, y) from the velocity field, the altitude z to facilitate a monocular camera, and yaw angle ψ to recover the direction of the field.},

	abstract = {The Central Equation of Dynamics allows a unified view on existing methods and reveals them as a specific view on one and the same classical mechanics. Thereby, the particular methods exhibit special advantages and disadvantages according to the aim of investigation. For the derivation of the motion equations, the analytical methods display some drawbacks: the use of non-holonomic velocities needs an enormous effort and non-holonomic constraints can not à-priori be considered. Due to the directional derivatives w.r.t. the angular velocities, the obtained linearized equations do not represent the motions w.r.t. the co-rotational frame(and any orthogonal frame, resp.) as usually requested. This fact may lead to severe misinterpretations. In elastic multi body systems, the calculation effort increases dramatically. All these drawbacks are removed when using the Projection Equation},

	abstract = {Many robotic systems are subject to nonholonomic as well as holonomic constraints. Rolling contact between two rigid bodies is a typical example of such a system. In the study, a unified state space formulation of robotic systems subject to both holonomic and nonholonomic constraints is presented. The position-level holonomic constraints are first replaced by a set of velocity-level constraint equations that asymptotically converge to the original holonomic constraints. Having represented both holonomic and nonholonomic constraints in a common form, a state space representation of the constrained systems is then developed. A numerical algorithm for implementing the state space representation is also described. The proposed formulation eliminates the need to solve holonomic constraints either analytically or numerically, and ensures that holonomic constraints are always satisfied, particularly in computer simulations. The formulation makes it possible to treat systems with holonomic constraints, with nonholonomic constraints, or with both holonomic and nonholonomic constraints in a unified framework. Two examples are presented to illustrate the application of the unified formulation.},
