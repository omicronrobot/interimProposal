\chapter{Conclusion}
The objective of this project was to design and fabricate a prototype mobile platform with holonomic and omnidirectional motion. This phase only involved the design work which was done conclusively. Design parameters were considered and the design work conducted to accommodate these parameters. The results are in line with the expected outcomes, as evidenced by the detailed CAD drawings produced.
\par
The next step will be implementation and fabrication of the developed design. However, it is expected that during this phase, few modifications and redesigns will have to be made to further optimise the design.
